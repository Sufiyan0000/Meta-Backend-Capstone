The Meta Backend Developer Capstone is the final project in the Meta Backend Developer Professional Certificate program on Coursera. It showcases a full backend application built using Python, Django, and REST API principles, applying all the key skills learned throughout the course.

In this capstone, I developed a fully functional restaurant reservation and menu management system (based on the Little Lemon project case study). The project demonstrates my ability to design and implement secure, scalable, and data-driven backend solutions.

⚙️ Key Features

Django Framework: Built a structured backend using Django and Django REST Framework.

API Development: Implemented RESTful endpoints for menu, booking, and authentication.

Database Integration: Used SQLite/PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

Authentication: Added user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.

Unit Testing: Wrote automated tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.

Deployment Ready: Backend can be deployed on platforms like Render, Railway, or AWS.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Python and Django fundamentals

API design and serialization (Django REST Framework)

Data modeling and ORM

Authentication and permissions

Unit testing and debugging

Version control (Git, GitHub)

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

🚀 Outcome

This capstone validates my ability to design, implement, and deploy production-ready backend services following industry best practices, and it serves as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating real-world backend engineering skills.
